# Live2D Arm Sway

:::caution
As of Warudo 0.12.3, this blueprint is no longer needed, as arm sway is now enabled by default pendulum physics settings. See [Pendulum Physics](../../mocap/pendulum-physics) for more information. This blueprint is helpful as a reference for manually adding pendulum physics to your character using blueprints.
:::

Arm sway is a common effect in Live2D models that adds a bit of life to the character by making the arms sway back and forth. This blueprint allows you to add this popular effect to your 3D model!
