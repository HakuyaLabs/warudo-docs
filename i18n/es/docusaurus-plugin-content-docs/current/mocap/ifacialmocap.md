# iFacialMocap/FaceMotion3D

ARKit-based face tracking. Requires a [Face ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208109)-compatible iOS device and the $5.99 [iFacialMocap](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1489470545) app. Tracks 52 ARKit blendshapes, head rotation and head translation.

An alternative to iFacialMocap is [FaceMotion3D](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemotion3d/id1507538005), which is $14.99 for a permanent license. It has more features than iFacialMocap, but in regard to face tracking for Warudo, the two apps are functionally equivalent.

:::tip
For best tracking quality, we recommend using an iPhone 12 or newer (iPhone mini also works). Older iPhones may have lower tracking quality.

:::info
If your iPhone is not compatible with Face ID, you may still be able to use iFacialMocap / FaceMotion3D if it has an A12 or higher chip and has been updated to iOS 14. However, the tracking quality may be subpar.
