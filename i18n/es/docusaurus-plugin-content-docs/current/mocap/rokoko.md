## Frequently Asked Questions

Please refer to [Overview](overview#FAQ) and [Customizing Pose Tracking](body-tracking#FAQ) for common questions.

### My tracking drifts over time.

This is a common issue with inertial motion capture systems, which drift over time due to accumulated errors. To reduce the drift, make sure there are no magnetic or electrical interference near the tracking sensors.
