# Overview

:::info
If you have not read the [Creating Your First Blueprint](../understanding-blueprints.md) section, we recommend that you do so before continuing.
:::

Creating a blueprint is really just a two-step process:

1. Find the nodes that we need;
2. Connect them together!

However, there are 300+ nodes in Warudo, and it can be difficult to know which ones to use. Moreover, what can you even do with blueprints? Hopefully, the following tutorials will give you a brief idea of what is possible.

:::tip
We have arranged the tutorials in the order of increasing difficulty. If you are new to Warudo, we recommend that you start with the first tutorial and work your way down.
