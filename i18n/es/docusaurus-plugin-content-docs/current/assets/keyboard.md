# Keyboard/Trackpad

Keyboard and trackpad are special props that (when combined with a blueprint) can generate animations for the character using keyboard and touchpad, even when the hands are not motion captured.

<p class="img-desc">No hand tracking required!</p>

## Setup

To use keyboard/trackpad, simply enable **Use Keyboard/Trackpad** during the motion capture setup. Please refer to the [Customizing Pose Tracking](../mocap/body-tracking) page for more details.

:::info
Currently, keyboard/trackpad are only supported for upper body tracking setups.
