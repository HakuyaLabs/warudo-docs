# NiloToon Character Controller

:::info
This feature is only available in [Warudo Pro](../pro). To add a NiloToon character controller to the scene, you must have Universal RP enabled in **Settings â†’ URP**.
:::

The NiloToon character controller allows you to adjust NiloToon settings on a character.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', gap: '1rem'}}>
<div>
<img src="/doc-img/en-nilotoon-char-color.png"  />
<p class="img-desc">Coloring character in black and white.</p>
</div>
<div style={{width: '73%'}} className="video-box"><video controls loop src="/doc-img/en-nilotoon-char-dissolve.mp4" />
<p>Dissolving the tail.</p>
</div>
</div>

Please refer to the NiloToon documentation for more details.

## Setup

Select the **Character** you want to adjust NiloToon settings for. If the character is configured with NiloToon, you will see its settings being read and shown in the asset.

You can adjust the settings directly in the asset, or control them using the **Set Asset Property** node in [blueprints](../blueprints/overview).
