# Overview

![](/doc-img/assets-cover.jpg)

Assets are the building blocks of Warudo. They are the components that make up your scene. For example, a character is an asset, a prop is an asset, and a camera is also an asset. Assets can be referenced in [blueprints](../blueprints/overview) to add further functionality to your scene.

## Interface

In the **Assets** tab, you can see a list of all assets in your scene. Once you select an asset, you can see its properties in the right panel.

The toolbar has the following buttons:
* **Add Asset**: Add a new asset to the scene.
* **Remove Asset**: Remove the selected asset from the scene.
* **Duplicate Asset**: Duplicate the selected asset.
* **Rename Asset**: Rename the selected asset.
* **Create Group**: Create group to organize asset. You can drag asset to manage the group.
* **Import Asset**: Import an asset from a JSON string and add it to the scene.
* **Import Into Selected Asset**: Import an asset from a JSON string and merge it into the selected asset.
* **Export Asset**: Export the selected asset to a JSON string.
